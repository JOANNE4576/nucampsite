I am liking "HTML" more, however I did not do any of it on this assignment.
I was not and still am not understanding how to get from the "terminal" to "GitHub", 
I have looked up several youtube videos, and still feel lost.
My approach was to take it one step at a time, the pieces are not sticking with me.
I used Youtube, freecodecamp, TA's quick questions, google.
